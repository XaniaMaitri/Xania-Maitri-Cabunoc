          <h3>My learning outcomes</h3>
          <p>Since I already have background knowledge about the fundamentals and basics of computing,<br>this lesson helped me refresh and recall the basics about the given topic.</br> 
          <br> I learned that there are actually a variety of professions and  career paths for people in the field<br>of computer technologies that ensure good salaries which for me is a good mind-opener.</br>
          <br> I have gained an understanding about the stages otherwise called, information processing cycle<br>and it helps me enhance my abilities when it comes to computing .</br>
          <br> This lesson helped me familiarize and understand the different aspects of computer systems,<br>that includes the hardware and software parts of a computer.</br>
          <br> I am now familiar with the number systems utilized in computing, enabling my skills in computing<br>to potentially improve and function efffectively. </br>
          <br> Personally, people nowadays should be knowledgable enough about the basics of computer security,<br>so this lesson was significant for people like us who are in the field of technology.</br>
          <br> Like I said, this another lesson is made me think of how significant it is to us. It helped and <br>reminded me of how to be always cautious and protective about what to share online. </br>
          <br> I gained addtional knowledge and was refreshed about the structure of the internet and the <br>World Wide Web, and I think it amazing how the internet works.</br>
          <br> This lesson has got to be my favorite one of the semester. It enabled me to be as creative<br> as I am in creating and designing my own website, not only that, this lesson also <br>challenged me in my skills in computing.</br>
